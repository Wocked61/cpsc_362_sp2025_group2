# Checkers

California State University, Fullerton repository for CPSC 362 Foundations of Software Engineering.

Checkers is a full-stack game hosted on a web application that allows one player to play against another player locally. Using the same computer, the players will be playing the game of checkers on a two-sided checkered board in which each player will take turns for each round to move their pieces diagonally until one player is eliminated. If our game is completed earlier than expected, future features will be implemented, and server-side gameplay can be implemented with a computer/player.

The front-end will be implemented in HTMl/CSS and JavaScript, and the back-end will be implemented in Python.
